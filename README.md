# Survey Report Builder üß∞

üîç The *Survey Report Builder* is a tool created to ease the viewing and processing of survey data. 

‚ùì The application is based off a survey conducted via Google Forms with each question prompting the participant to make a selection from 1-5. The **.csv** generated by the quiz is fed to the application which returns a **.docx** file filled with a graph for each question in the google form (see example below). 

‚è±Ô∏è The hours this saves HR representatives leaves more time for them to focus on building relationships, coaching leaders, and creating better workplaces.
